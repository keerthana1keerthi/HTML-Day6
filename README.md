# Day 6 – Complete HTML Registration Form with Validations

# Overview:
On Day 6, I developed a complete user registration form using HTML5, with extended validation and input controls. This includes handling text input, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, dropdown menus, and a linked submission response page.

# Features Implemented:
- ✅ Text Fields: First name (readonly), Last name (disabled), Email, Password
- 📅 Date Field with restricted range (2000 to 2040)
- 🔢 Age field with min and max restrictions
- ♂️ Radio buttons: Gender and Citizenship status
- 🧠 Technology selection using checkboxes
- 🗣️ Textarea for user comments
- 📂 File upload for profile picture (with `multiple` option)
- 🌍 Country dropdown selector
- ✔️ Terms and conditions agreement checkbox
- 🔁 Reset and Submit buttons
- ✅ Redirect to a welcome page (`welcom.html`) after submission

# Form Validation Techniques Practiced:
- `required`, `readonly`, `disabled`
- `minlength`, `min`, `max`
- `accept`, `multiple`
- Grouped radio buttons and checkbox handling

# Future Improvements:
- Add CSS to style the form and improve visual presentation
- Connect the form to a backend using PHP/Node.js for real submission handling
- Implement JS validation for better UX
